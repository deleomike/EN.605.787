## Assignments Policy

> Late assignments are not accepted unless you contact me in advance and will receive an F. “In advance” means at most 2 business days after the assignment has been assigned. Since our course is based on Wednesday, that means by Friday night.
>
>The reason for an extension almost doesn’t matter: business trip, vacation, family will be in town, feeling overwhelmed and need a break this week, hired someone to do the assignment and still negotiating the price… Ok, maybe not that last one.
>
>What does matter is that you ask for it in a timely and responsible manner. Obviously, timing exceptions are made if a sickness or some other emergency arises that can’t be known in advance. In all such cases, please email Yaakov (and CC the grader) at your earliest availability to do so.
>
>As long as you follow these guidelines, an extension is almost always granted.
>
>That is my approach because we are not in high school and no one is going to lose a client or die if you turn in your assignment late. 😊 Life happens. All I have to require is some standard such that it can equally be applied to every student in the class.
>
>There are limitations to the extensions. Extensions past the end of the semester can be granted, but will result in me having to give you an Incomplete. After completing the assignment and having it graded, you can change the grade from an Incomplete to a regular grade, but JHU requires you to fill out a form and pay some administrative fee to them for that. Also, if you are graduating this semester, having an Incomplete will probably push off your graduation date another semester.
>
>You must have an email from me stating that I granted you an extension. Please keep the email stating that you were granted an extension until the end of the course (when you receive your final course grade). If I (or the grader) made a mistake, you’ll have proof of the extension.
>
>Some advice: if you are not sure you are going to be able to complete the assignment on time because of a business trip, family trip, etc., email me within the 2 business days after the assignment stating this, i.e., notifying me that you might need an extension. Emailing me a day before the due date asking for an extension because you were on a business trip and you thought you were going to be able to finish is not a good enough excuse.
